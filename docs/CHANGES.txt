    if you want to display which Always notify that have been notified.

    New feature. If you call rss.xml?show=all then it also shows
    threads/follow ups are items with "Followup to." added to the

    and if you want to strip HTML formatted emails you are advised to
    install Strip-o-Gram from http.//www.zope.org/Members/chrisw/StripOGram
    For this to work you are expected to set up some sort of cron job
    to periodically check for new email.

    to e.g. c<a href="mailto.opyright@dot.com">opyright@dot.com</a>.

    reindexes all objects.

    New feature. added showURL2Issue() which concatenates too
    long URLs in ShowIssueData.
